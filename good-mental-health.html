                      <p>Talking about your feelings isn’t a sign of weakness. It’s part of taking charge of your wellbeing and doing what you can to stay healthy. Talking can be a way to cope with a problem you’ve been carrying around in your head for a
                        while.
                      </p>
                      <p>Just being listened to can help you feel supported and less alone. And it works both ways. If you open up, it might encourage others to do the same.</p>
                      <p>It may feel awkward at first, give it time. Make talking about your feelings something that you do</p>
