                    <h3>The 'One Hour Rule' I Use on Days When Mental Illness Makes It Hard to Get Out of Bed </h3>
                    <p>I tell myself: Just try. Get out of bed and get up. If it doesn’t work, and in an hour you feel worse, then you can go back to bed.5 And sometimes, I will. And that’s OK. But I make myself try. Try to taste the day. I don’t have to
                      like it, I just have to do it.

                    <h3>I have never been ashamed of being bipolar, of having a mental health condition of any kind. </h3>
                    <p>I have never been ashamed of being bipolar, of having a mental health condition of any kind. I’m not responsible for my genes, my childhood, it’s nothing anyone would choose. I am so unashamed that the recent hashtag #imnotashamed
                      caught me be surprised. Why would I need to assert that? How sad it is that anyone would have to assert that.

                    <h3>My family and friends were shocked to learn I had a mental illness </h3>
                    <p>t is important for us all to recognise that mental illness can happen to any of us. In fact, it affects 1 in 4 of us throughout our lifetimes. This is why it is so important to understand it and support those who are suffering.

                    <h3>My Battle with Depression and How Theatre Helped </h3>
                    <p>I also feel that it’s vital to understand what treatments are best for different individuals. Some people need therapy, some people need drugs, some people need exercise and some people need art... There is no one size fits all rule
                      when it comes to treatment. Research could help match people up to the best treatment option for them.
